I am a fourth year undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, studying electrical engineering, with a bit of condensed matter physics and materials science on the side. My primary interests are in nanofabrication (['there's plenty of room at the bottom'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_Plenty_of_Room_at_the_Bottom)) and manufacturing, but I am pretty enthusiastic about anything which involves building. 

I am currently spending a semester abroad at EPFL where I am  working on fabricating and packaging high-density electrode arrays using off-the-shelf CMOS chips on flexible substrates. This work is at [Prof. Stephanie Lacour's](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lsbi/) lab at Campus Biotech, Geneva. 

You can find some of the stuff I have worked on [here](https://abhineet-agarwal.github.io/projects/). 


Have always found it difficult to be put in a box. Non-exhaustive list of things I am currently into:
- Semiconductor Devices and VLSI Technology
- Manufacturing, especially in Tier-2 India
- AI + EDA, and automating process engineering
- The future of personal devices
- Developmental Economics
- Induction ovens for some reason?

Besides work, I love music - trained as a vocalist, trying out new sports (currently - rowing!) and backpacking. I also avidly follow and read about politics, history and the technology landscape here in India and the world. You can find my reading list [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52986688-abhineet-agarwal), and some of my writing [here](https://abhineet-agarwal.github.io/blog/).
