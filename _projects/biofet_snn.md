**Type:** Reading Project 

**Duration:** Jun - Jul 2024

- Studied methods to identify amino acid and peptide fingerprints by transducing amphoteric signatures into surface potential and capacitance vs pH profiles using CMOS-based bioFETs
- Studied hardware implementations of spiking neural networks using PDSOI MOSFET based LIF neurons
- Worked on combining the two so that the surface potential controls the spiking frequency rather than I_DS
