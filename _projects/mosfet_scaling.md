**Course:** EE620 - Physics of Transistors

**Instructor:** Prof. Souvik Mohapatra

**Duration:** Mar - Apr 2025

- Scaled transistor from 1μm to 0.18μm gate length with halo implants for short-channel effect control
- Achieved Vₜₕ reduction from 1V to 0.85V and 100× Iₒₙ improvement, optimizing through TCAD simulations
- Used Hurkx BTBT tunneling and mobility degradation models to demonstrate DIBL control at 118 mV/V
