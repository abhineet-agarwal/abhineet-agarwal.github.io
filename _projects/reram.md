**Guide:** Prof. Veeresh Deshpande

**Duration:** Aug 2025 - Present

- Undergoing cleanroom training in photolithography, thin-film deposition (sputtering/ALD), annealing etc.
- Fabricating a W/WOₓ/HfO₂/Pt stack, performing DC and pulse programming over 100+ cycles to study SET/RESET behavior, endurance and retention
- Validating results using GENESTRA simulations
