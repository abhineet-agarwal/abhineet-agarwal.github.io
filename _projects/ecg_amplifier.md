**Course:** EE230 - Analog Lab | **Instructor:** Prof. Anil Kottantharayil

**Duration:** Apr 2024

- Assembled a 3-stage ECG amplifier with leg drive section to minimize common-mode interference, biasing an INA fed by the left and right hand
- Implemented low pass and notch filters to reduce high frequency and line noise
- Plotted and analyzed the readings, using LTSpice for circuit simulations and parameter tuning
