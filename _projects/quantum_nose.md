**Duration:** May 2024 - Present

- Used the NEGF method for 3D quantum transport calculations exploiting RTDs for room-temperature IETS
- Proposed a novel mode-based approach to determine relevant inelastic transport channels in a 3D RTD
- Investigating different heterostructures such as GaAs–AlAs and IGZO–SiO₂ for the fabrication of the RTDs
- Designing a nanoampere front-end and a novel sub-threshold PDFET based low-noise IETS readout method
