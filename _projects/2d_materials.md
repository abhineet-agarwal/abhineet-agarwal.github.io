**Course:** EE784 - 2D Materials and Electronics | **Instructor:** Prof. Saurabh Lodha

**Duration:** Mar - Apr 2025

- Modeled and simulated MoS₂/SiC Esaki diodes using NEGF formalism, reproducing experimental NDR peaks
- Developed models for MoS₂ BioFETs to study surface charge effects, predicting Vₜₕ shifts and SS trends
- Proposed a novel SiC/SiO₂/MoS₂/SiO₂/SiC RTD and its fabrication process flow for room-temperature IETS
