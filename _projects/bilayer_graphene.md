**Course:** PH436 - Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics | **Instructor:** Prof. Hridis Kumar Pal

**Duration:** Nov 2024

- Derived tight-binding Hamiltonian for bilayer graphene and plotted band structures near K-points on Python
- Analyzed effects of varying hopping parameters and Vg on band structure evolution and bandgap opening
- Derived effective two-band low-energy Hamiltonian by eliminating dimer states, showing massive chirality
