**Course:** EE309 - Microprocessors | **Instructor:** Prof. Virendra Singh

**Duration:** Apr - May 2024

- Designed a 16-bit Turing-complete RISC processor with a 6-stage pipeline and a 26 instruction ISA
- Implemented the design consisting of ALUs, Register File, 5 pipeline registers, control & hazard unit in VHDL
- Wrote a testbench to verify the design using RTL and gate-level simulation and checked for synthesizability
